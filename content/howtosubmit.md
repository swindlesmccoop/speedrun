# For Technical People

### Step 1
If you have not already, create an account on [Github](https://github.com).

### Step 2
Visit the [repository for the website](https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/speedrun).

### Step 3
Press the Fork button and create a fork of the repository.

### Step 4
Edit the file for the game that you want to submit a run for in the same convention as the rest of the submissions.

### Step 5
Create a pull request on the main repository.

### Step 6
The pull request will be forwarded to a moderator of the game you are submitting for, which will be approved or denied for merging based on the merit of the run.

### Step 7
The site gets updated every hour, so check back later to see your run on the leaderboard!

# For Not-So Technical People

### Step 1
If you have not already, create an account on [Github](https://github.com).

### Step 2
Visit the [repository for the website](https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/speedrun/issues).

### Step 3
Create a new issue.

### Step 4
Title your issue like so:\
**\[*Name of Game*\] *run time, date***\
In the contents of the issue, include a link to the video of your submission. Based on the merit of the run, the submission will either be approved or denied. However, moderators must manually add the time to the leaderboard, so this process may take a bit of extra time.
