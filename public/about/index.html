<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
<p>I created this site due to disagreeing with how the moderation on a more prolific, yet not to be named speedrun leaderboard website decides to moderate. Rather than banning people over unproven allegations or political issues, we only ban runners for cheating.</p>
<h1 id="technical-information">Technical Information</h1>
<p>The way that this site is run is using a static site generator called Hugo. This way, we can avoid running any kind of JavaScript, with the nice side effect of having a clean, fast-loading site. I promise to never run ads on this site as long as it is financially viable. The site is very small in size, allowing me to use free hosting. Domains cost less than a 4chan Pass every year so the domain is not an issue.</p>
<h1 id="donations">Donations</h1>
<p>I will never ask anybody for, nor require, donations of any kind. However, if you feel compelled to donate anything, anything is appreciated. As I said before, this site costs a small amount of money each year to run as it is quite small, though depending on the size that this site expands to, I may need to start paying for hosting. If you feel like donating at all, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:swindlesmccoop@waifu.club">swindlesmccoop@waifu.club</a>.</p>
