<h3 id="step-2-1">Step 2</h3>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://github.com/swindlesmccoop/speedrun/issues">repository for the website</a>.</p>

<p>Create a new issue.</p>
<h3 id="step-4-1">Step 4</h3>
<p>Title your issue like so:<br>
<strong>[Name of Game] <em>run time</em></strong><br>
In the contents of the issue, include a link to the video of your submission. Based on the merit of the run, the submission will either be approved or denied. However, moderators must manually add the time to the leaderboard, so this process may take a bit of extra time.</p>

<p>The way that this site is run is using a static site generator. This way, we can avoid running any kind of JavaScript, with the nice side effect of having a clean, fast-loading site. I promise to never run ads on this site as long as it is financially viable. The site is very small in size, allowing me to use free hosting. Domains cost less than a 4chan Pass every year so the domain is not an issue.</p>
